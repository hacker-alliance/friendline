            <h2>917-341-7837 everyday, 3pm EST</h2>
            <h4>Have a friendly chat in strange times.</h4>
        </div>
        <h2><a id="about">How Does It Work?</a></h2>
        <h4>Simply. Designed for everyone</h4>
        <p>Everyday at 3:00 pm (EST), Neighborline is open for calls.
            <br>Dial the number to be placed on the line with another caller for a chat.
            <br>Think of Neighborline as a way of striking up small spontaneous conversations.</p>

        <h2><a id="guidelines">Community Guidelines</a></h2>
        <h4>A little kindness goes a long way</h4>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>There is <b>NO PLACE</b> for hatred or intolerance on Neighborline.  If you encounter this, <a href="#contact"><b>HANG UP & REPORT IT</b></a> to us.</li> 
        <li><b>DO NOT REVEAL PERSONAL DETAILS</b>, including your telephone number. Neighborline is designed to keep your number safe.</li>
        <li>This is <b>NOT A CRISIS LINE</b>. If you need help or critical support, look at the resources provided below.</li>
        <li><b>BE KIND.</b> Build bridges. Our circumstances may be different but everyone is struggling right now.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Feeling Shy?</h2>
        <h4>That's okay, it happens to the best of us</h4>
        <p>Here are some tips for making good conversation.</p>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li>Keep it brief! A small conversation can be a beautiful thing.</li>
            <li>Bring your gratitude. Think of one thing that you are grateful for, and share it.</li>
            <li>Ask a good question. What have you read recently? Have you seen a fun movie? Tell your neighbor.</li>
            <li>Be vulnerable. It's ok to have a bad day. Expressing- within reason- it can help.</li>
            <li>Don't try to solve anyone's problems. It's ok to just listen. In fact, it's often better than advice!</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Who's on the Line?</h2>
        <h4>Your neighbors & fellow New Yorkers</h4>
        <p>Neighborline creates an opportunity for daily connection in a challenging time.<br>
            <br>This daily call can be especially helpful for localized communities in isolation who may not have access to highly-networked circles online, like the elderly or those without access to the internet. Truly, Neighborline is for anyone who has a phone.</p>

        <h2><a id="contact">Problems? Questions?</a></h2> 
        <h4>Uh-oh. Let's try to fix it</h4>

        <h4>Something to look forward to, daily</h4>
        <p>Normally, New Yorkers share impromtu exchanges as we move through our city. As we stay home, we need to find new ways of being neighborly. Like a cheer at 7pm, it's important for us to create rituals and have something to look forward to everyday.<br>
            <br>At the moment, Neighborline has is serving New York. We hope Neighborline can be a model for other areas around the country and the world. We’re providing all the documentation and resources for Neighborline to inspire others to replicate, reimagine, and rediscover the magic of a good, old-fashioned phone call.</p>
